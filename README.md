# `pop`

> `pop.dart`'s a set of utility methods and classes to make Dart development intuitive, simple, and readable.

`pop.dart`'s goal is to provide data structures, algorithms and utilities (in forms of functions, classes and static extension methods) to make your Dart code more expressive, concise and readable without compromising on performance and type safety.

## Motivation

As I was writing Dart code, I noticed that I keep re-implementing the same patterns over and over again in various projects.
This package tries to implement common data structures and algorithms that make the code more expressive and fast.

Of course, as always, this package is not a silver-bullet, and there are great packages by the Dart team that significantly improve the Dart developer experience and that are actually battle-tested.
Some of these are: [`dart:collection`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-collection/dart-collection-library.html), [`package:collection`](https://pub.dev/packages/collection), [`package:quiver`](https://pub.dev/packages/quiver).
The `pop` package aims to complement these packages, and only "re-invent the wheel" where I am unhappy with the implementation in those libraries.

## Usage

A detailed, beginner-friendly guide with examples is coming soon.
For now, please refer to the [API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/pop/latest/).
I am doing my best to provide a great documentation with plenty of examples for every function, class and method of this package.
